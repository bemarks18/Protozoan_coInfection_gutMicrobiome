This is the official github repository for our paper: -insert appropriate link-

The full pipeline of our microbiome analysis is attached in `Protozoan_Coinfection_gutMicrobiome.Rmd` and includes:

-alpha diversity analysis

-beta diversity analysis

-relative and differential abundance analysis

-linear discriminant analysis

-Protozoan infection status prediction with an ML model
